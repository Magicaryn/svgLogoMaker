# svgLogoMaker

This application is a command line interface enabling the user to create simple custom logo. The command line will prompt the user with 4 questions: what initials, what color font, what shape for the background and what color they would like the shape to be. This application is good for a first time developer to create a logo to their pages to leave an impression on the viewers. 

This application was challenging as i have never worked with SVG elements before as well as never used OOP. I feel like OOP seemed just as complicated while learning it as it did when i tried to apply it.
